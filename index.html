				Thanks for visiting! This is a home for the major personal projects that I've developed. Each was motivated by a blend of three reasons: to feed my own interest, to solve problems that I've encountered, and to learn about new tools that interested me. I dig into them whenever I have extra time to spend (which is usually between school quarters!).
